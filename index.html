          I have worked around engineers for over 15 years, in my experience, 
          there are two types of engineers.  There are those that attain certain level of
          comfort and cease to grow.  There are others that live and breate technology and continue
          to grow yearly in their ability and usefulness.  Myke is the kind of engineer that continues
          to grow technically.
          <span>&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          But before closing, it would be unfair if I didn’t also acknowledge his spirit.
          Myke is an engaging, funny, positive and thoughtful guy who cares deeply for his
          riends and family.  A highlight of my visits to HQ is the casual lunch for which
          Myke and I always make time.  I highly recommend Myke for any network management role,
          but I also recommend him as a lunch-buddy.

          <span>&#8220;</span>
          I simply cannot say enough good things about Myke Encarnacion. To write a letter of
          recommendation is bitter sweet in that we will dearly miss his capability, professionalism,
          positive attitude and his camaraderie.  But after getting to know Myke and understanding
          his goals for the future, I can only wish him the best of luck and offer whatever
          help I can provide.  He will be an asset for any organization!
